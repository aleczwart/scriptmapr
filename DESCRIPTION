Title: Graphic Display of Object/Symbol Locations In An R Script
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Alexander", "Zwart",email = "alec.zwart@csiro.au", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides function scriptmap(), which creates a ggplot2
    display of the line numbers in an R script of expressions
    that contain specific R objects or symbols - based on the
    output from getParseData(parse()). When analysing many
    responses in a script, there is a lot of cut/paste/edit,
    and scriptmap() can be useful for detecting oversights in
    editing.  IMPORTANT: Note that scriptmap() does not (yet)
    search inside character string literals...
